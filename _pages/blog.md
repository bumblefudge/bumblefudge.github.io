As a lifelong writer across varies veins (academic, professional, literary, critical, political) I have always felt it important to do a little writing just for me.  When I was a literature professor, I advised any student that wanted to some day make a living writing to *always*, without fail, write (or carefully, lovingly translate) at least one thing every week for themself, lest the writing-muscle deep in them should atrophy from too much coursework, or term-paper-ing, or vacationing, livelihood-earning, or what have you.  As a professor, I ate that dogfood, but didn't keep receipts or records.

Now, in a different phase of my life altogether, I finally feel I am rooted enough to get back to taking my own advice.  I will be doing so here, over the coming weeks, and as time allows digging up old writings from [past](http://caballerojuan.tumblr.com) [lives](http://tortaface.com).
